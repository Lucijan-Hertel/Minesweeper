Minesweeper is now finally finished!

Main Game: 
- Completely working 
- Algorithm is checking if its playable until its playable

Help:
- can be activated by pressing h
- gives you an "island" of 0 fields
- if there is none, it makes just one field next to a field visible, which is already visible

Algorithm: 
- completes the game for you
- Has the Info a normal player has 
- uses the rules we humans are using to complete it

If you watch in the code, you will see how you use a debug menu
