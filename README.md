Main Game:
It is completely playable but sometimes not solvable without guessing. I am trying to solve that.

Cheats / Developer Mode:
With Left ALT you can see specific information about every field when you hover it.
With right ALT you can finish the game because it makes all the bombs visible with leads to the finish requirement

Help:
If you cant continue and you need help, you can press H. With that it will show you an area with zeros so that you get another "island". You can press it 3 times until it gets disabled. Dont press it if you already know that there is no "island" left

Algorithm:
By pressing K, you activate the algorithm which solves the game as far as possible without guessing with the same information you have.
